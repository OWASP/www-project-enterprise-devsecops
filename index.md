pitch: Enterprise Security Program Design with OWASP

INTRODUCTION

The main focus for this project is to explore strategic utilization
of OWASP projects in enterprise with attention on DevSecOps,
information security management systems and infrastructure-as-code.

We will examine the components of DevSecOps, or namely:
development lifecycles, security lifecycles, and business operations
and then take a holistic approach to security program management by
investigating the effectiveness of DevSecOps through the lens of each
component.

This project will also explore enterprise security program concepts,
compliance alignment planning, risk management activities,
threat intelligence, vulnerability management, architecture and
infrastructure, performance measurement, continuous monitoring,
situational awareness, and security training.

I chose to lead this project because I am often posed with the
question of what is OWASP, how is it used, and is it just for software
developers? We will explore these questions and more as we set out to
discover why cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility
and how security controls effect policies and governance.

My name is Princeton Brooke and I welcome you along this journey.
My career as a software programmer spans over 30 years.
I was 8 years old when I landed my first job as a programmer for the
Cleveland Public Schools system where I developed and maintained
a student database that was utilized by most of the
teachers in my school and was integrated into the school's office
for administrative use. I was 13 when I landed my next programming
gig as a database developer for the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections.

My passion for strategy alignment for compliance and execution,
security program design, and IT project management was fostered
by several technical lead roles including strategy and compliance focused
software and web developer positions in real-estate, higher education,
federal contracting, and healthcare. It was across these positions
that I experienced the power of teams and the goal of operational
dynamics enabled by information systems.
